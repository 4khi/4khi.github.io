<p><strong>One must understand that the mujahid should be ready at all times for war so that if a khilafah is established and the khalifah calls upon him to fight for the sake of <span class="Arab">الله</span> against the kuffar in order to implement the word of <span class="Arab">الله</span> he should be combat ready so that he can be capable in the battlefield and so that </strong><strong>he should not be a burden upon his brothers. </strong></p>
<p><strong>If one is not at the required capacity, he should work towards the goal of attaining this state of physical and mental strength as well as that of his iman , with sincere intentions of earning the pleasure of سُبْحَانَهُ وَتَعَالَى &lrm; <span class="Arab">الله </span><br /></strong></p>
